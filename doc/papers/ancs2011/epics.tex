%Beyond doubt, the Internet has grown out of its infancy. Yet, 
Network programming is widely understood as programming strictly defined socket
interfaces. Only some frameworks (e.g., ANA, Click, Active Networking) have made a step
towards \emph{real} network programming by decomposing networking functionality
into small modular blocks that can be assembled in a flexible manner. In this
paper, we tackle the challenge of accommodating 3 partially conflicting
objectives: (i) high flexibility for network programmers and network
application designers, (ii) re-configuration of the network stack at runtime,
and (iii) high packet forwarding rates.  First experiences with a prototype
implementation in Linux suggest little performance overhead compared to the 
standard Linux protocol stack.

\section{Introduction}
Beyond doubt, the Internet has grown out of its infancy and has become a
critical infrastructure for private and business applications. Its success is
largely due to the plethora of transport media (SONET, wired and wireless
Ethernet, etc.) it uses and to the rich network applications (e.g., web, p2p, VoIP,
online social networks) it offers. Yet, \emph{network programming} is still
mainly about programming sockets that form a strictly defined interface between
the networking (TCP/IP) and the actual application part (Facebook, VoIP, etc.).
What if designers of network applications could even tailor the networking
functionality to their needs? We can just speculate about the resulting
innovations. 

Besides allowing application designers to program their own networking stack,
we envision future Internet applications that \emph{dynamically} adjust their
network setup/stack during runtime. To give an example: already nowaday's
websites sometimes redirect users from an HTTP to an SSL-encrypted HTTPS
connection before sensitive data is exchanged. The step from dynamic
application-level (SSL-based) to more comprehensive network-layer (IPsec)
encryption appears small. Yet, enabling a network application to switch to an
IPSec connection while retaining connectivity is challenging. 

%Additionally, nowadays protocol stacks assume that the timely variances in a
%communication channel can be covered by adaptive parameters inside a single
%protocol. However, this might not be true for long lasting communications (e.g.
%in sensor networks). Network characteristics, privacy or security concerns
%might change with time. The protocol stack should be able to accommodate for
%such changes without the need for restarting the applications. 
Research efforts in this area include active networking~\cite{ANSurvey2}, Click
modular router project\cite{click}, or OpenFlow~\cite{openflow}. However, none
of the available implementations fulfils the following three partially
conflicting goals. 
%The fast speed of the growth of the Internet and the huge effect on everyday life could lead to the thought that it is perfectly designed and nothing should be changed on the underlying architecture. However, researcher are working continuously on new protocols that improve the communication performance for different communication scenarios. Be it in the area of routing, transport or completely new network architectures. The evaluation of such protocols has shown to be difficult as simulations are not realistic enough and as it is difficult to change anything in standard operating systems protocol stacks. To overcome this difficulty some environments dedicated for testing were built, for example Click \cite{click} and openflow \cite{openflow} in the routing area or NetFPGA \cite{netFPGA} for the evaluation of hardware implementations. None of these platforms is specifically designed for evaluating protocols on the end nodes and none of these platforms are designed for an adaptation of the protocol stack at run time. In this paper we present the architecture of a framework that is designed for the following three goals. 
\begin{compactenum}
%\item Provide a platform in which it is easy to test new protocols on end nodes. In order to simplify testing further it should not require any specialized hardware. 
\item Simple integration and testing of new protocols on end nodes on all layers of the protocol stack.
\item Runtime reconfiguration of the protocol stack in order to allow for even bigger flexibility.
\item High performance packet forwarding rate.
%\item Provide a platform that imposes as little overhead as possible. This is required that the evaluation of new protocols delivers meaningful results. 
%\item Provide a platform which allows us to continuously optimize the protocol stack. This is especially useful in mobile scenarios where network characteristics such as delay or packet loss change frequently. Being able to use a protocol optimized for the given network characteristics might improve the connection quality drastically.
\end{compactenum}

Therefore, we propose another architecture that was designed with these objectives in mind.
The architecture is based on the ideas of the \textit{Autonomic Network Architecture (ANA)}. \cite{ANAJournal}. In ANA network functionality is divided into \textit{functional blocks (FB)} that can be combined as required. Each FB implements a protocol such as \textit{ip, udp, encryption, content centric routing, etc.} ANA does not impose any protocols to be used other than Ethernet, rather it provides a framework that allows for the flexible composition and recomposition of FBs to a protocol stack. This allows for the experimentation with protocol stacks that are not known by todays standard operating system and it allows for the optimization of protocol stacks at runtime without communication tear down or application support.
The existing implementation of ANA shows the feasibility of such a flexible architecture but it suffers sever performance issues. 
In this paper we present the \textit{Lightweight Autonomic Network Architecture (LANA)}. It allows for a similar functionality than ANA but demonstrates that flexibility does not have to come at the cost of reduced performance.



\section{LANA: Approach}


%\wolfgang{quickly say first why you propose another architecture; e.g., Click configuration if an kernel cannot be changed at runtime or not happy with Ana's performance; it should be come clear that we try to accommodate conflicting objectives, see my abstract}
%LANA provides a framework for setting up protocol stacks not known by todays standard operating systems. Within LANA it is also possible to change the protocol stack at runtime, without communication teardown or application support. These properties build the basis for a networking system that provides protocol stacks that are better targeted to a networking situation than the well known TCP/IP protocol stack.

%LANA provides a framework for setting up protocol stacks not known by 
%todays standard operating systems. Within LANA it is also possible to 
%change the protocol stack at runtime, without communication teardown or 
%application support. These properties build the basis for a networking 
%system that provides protocol stacks that are better targeted to a 
%networking situation than the well known TCP/IP protocol stack.

Generally, the LANA network system is built similarly to the network subsystem of the Linux kernel.
Applications can send and transmit packets via the BSD socket interface. The actual packet processing is done in a \textit{packet processing engine (PPE)} in the kernel space. An overview of the architecture is presented in (Figure \ref{fig:architecture}).

%\daniel{too much is said about the vlink interface. I'd rather save the words for the PPE or functional blocks. I think about a better paragraph for tomorrow}

The hardware and device driver interfaces are hidden from the PPE behind a \textit{virtual link interface}, which allows for a simple integration of different underlaying networking technologies such as Ethernet, Bluetooth or InfiniBand.
% Additionally, virtual link interface devices are represented as usual kernel networking devices and can be managed with standard tools such as \texttt{ifconfig} or \texttt{ethtool}.

Each functional block is implemented as a Linux kernel module. 
Upon module insertion a constructor for the creation of an instance of the FB is registered with the LANA core. Upon configuration of the protocol stack the instances of the FBs are created. The instances register a \textit{receive function} with the PPE. This function is called when a packet needs to be processed.
%It offers a \textit{receive handler} that is invoked by the PPE upon packet processing. Functional blocks are built as objects of a specific type. Their build handlers are registered to the LANA core during module registration. 

Functional blocks can either drop a packet, forward a packet to either ingress or egress direction or duplicate a packet. After having processed a packet the FB returns the identifier of the next FB that should process this packet. In addition, FB belonging to the virtual link interface will queue the packets in the network drivers transmit queue and FB communicating with BSD sockets will queue the packets in the sockets receive queue.

The PPE is responsible for calling one FB after the other and for queuing packets that need to be processed.

%Data is transmitted between the functional blocks by function calls and is 
%therefore not being copied between functional blocks.
% A network packet is 
%processed by the LANAs packet processing engine, which calls receive handlers 
%of functional blocks that are bound to each other in the processing path. Data is then 
%either forwarded to the subsequent functional block or discarded. A certain
%path can be traversed in ingress or egress direction, thus functional
%blocks can also flip the packets direction within the packet processing engine.
%Moreover, the packet processing engine has per-CPU backlog queues so that
%functional blocks which spawn new network packets can enqueue the like for
%processing.

%There are two special functional blocks - those of the virtual link interfaces 
%communicating with a network driver and those communicating with BSD sockets.
%These functional blocks push network packets either in the drivers transmit 
%queue or in the sockets receive queue.

\subsection{Configuration Interface}
The protocol stack can be configured from user space with the help of a 
command line tool. The most important commands are summarized below.
\begin{compactitem}
\item \texttt{add}, \texttt{rm}: Adds (removes) an FB from the 
      list of available FBs in the kernel. 
\item \texttt{set}: sets properties of an FB with a 
      \texttt{key=value} semantic
\item \texttt{bind}, \texttt{unbind}: Binds (unbinds) an FB 
      to another FB in order to be able to send messages to it. 
\item \texttt{replace}: Replaces one FB with another 
      FB. The connections between the blocks are maintained. 
      Private data can either be transferred to the new block or dropped.
%\item \texttt{subscribe}, \texttt{unsubscribe}: Subscribes (Unsubscribes) one 
%      functional block to receive event messages from another functional block.
%      (An implicit subscribtion (unsubscribtion) is done on bind (unbind).)
\end{compactitem}
Within the Linux kernel the notification chain framework is used to propagate those configuration messages to the individual FBs. 
%This framework is also used to distribute other, internal, configuration messages. 

\subsection{Improving the Performance}
We have evaluated different possibilities for the integration of the PPE with the 
Linux kernel. We summarize our insights to provide guidance for researchers that have to do fundamental changes on the Linux protocol stack.

We compared the maximum packet reception rate of the Linux kernel while not doing any packet processing with our architecture. Here, packets are forwarded between three FBs that do only packet forwarding. 

%Our goal was to be able to process as many \textit{minimum sized Ethernet frames} 
%as the Linux kernel is able to process. In order to compare the performance of 
%the Linux Kernel and the performance of our engine we have bypassed all packets 
%from the Linux Kernel protocol stack into the LANA stack via a
%\texttt{netdev\_rx\_handler} in bottom half context as soon as they arrived.

%In our system the packets were processed by the \texttt{fb\_eth} functional 
%block followed by two \texttt{fb\_dummy} functional blocks that were simply 
%forwarding the packets. We can distinguish the following three approaches:
\begin{compactitem}
\item One high priority LANA thread per CPU achieves approx. half the performance of the default stack. The performance degradation is due to 'starvation' of the software interrupt handler (ksoftirqd). Changing the priority of the LANA thread only slightly increases the throughput.
% (since the ksoftirqd is a low-priority thread).
\item Explicit preemption and scheduling control achieves approx. two third of the performance of the default stack. The performance degradation is due to scheduling overhead. 
\item Execution of the PPE in ksoftirqd context. This approach achieves
      approx. $95\%$ of the performance of default stack.
\end{compactitem}

The corresponding numbers are listed in Table \ref{tab:performance}.
\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{tabular}{ l r }
Mechanism & Performance\\
\hline
Dedicated kernel thread (high priority) & 700.000\\
Dedicated kernel thread (normal priority) & 750.000\\
Dedicated kernel thread (controlled scheduling) & 900.000\\
Execution in ksoftirqd & 1.300.000\\

\subsection{Software Available}
\wolfgang{I'd prefer to merge this section 2.1 ``Configuration Interface''. Then, we can market the performance results at a prominent position of the paper, at the end. I would call the new section ``Implementation''}
The current software is available under the GNU General Public License from 
\cite{lana}. In addition to the framework it also includes four functional 
blocks: Ethernet, Berkeley Packet Filter, Tee (duplication of packets), Packet 
Counter and Forward (an empty block that forwards the packets to 
another block). The framework does not need any patching of the Linux kernel
but it requires a new Linux 3.X kernel.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have shown that it is possible to implement a flexible protocol stack that has a similar performance than the default protocol stack in the Linux kernel. The flexibility allows for the easy inclusion of new, still to be developed protocols and for the change of the protocol stack at runtime. Both might lead to a protocol stack that is better suited for a given networking situation than the well known TCP/IP protocol stack.
%to include for example compression or encryption as the networking conditions change. 

In the short-term we will compare the performance of our system with the performance of other systems (e.g., default Linux stack, Click router, etc.). 
In the mid-term we will work on mechanisms that automatically configure protocol stacks based on the applications as well as the networks needs. 
%Applications will characterize which properties a communication channel should have and monitoring elements will provide information about the network. A controller will be responsible for negotiating a protocol stack with a peer and for setting up the protocol stack on the local node.
The end goal is have a networked system that requires less configuration as compared to todays networks and that is able to adapt itself to changing network conditions.   



%In the midterm we will develop a mechanism that automatically sets up a protocol stack for an Application whereby the Application can specify some characteristics the communication channel should have, but not exactly how this has to be achieved. For example the application could require a "reliable communication channel" and a controller would choose between different protocols that provide reliability (e.g., one for wired communication, one for wireless communication, one for wireless, multi-hop communication). The setup of the protocol stack will have to be negotiated between the source and destination node.
